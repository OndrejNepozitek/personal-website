After a few months of work, I finally managed to release an alpha version of a Unity dungeon generation plugin that is based on my procedural level generator library described in the previous posts on this blog.

*UPDATE (10.1.2022):* The Unity plugin has been in development for a few years now and is now pretty stable and production-ready. It is called **Edgar** and you can find it on [github](https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/Edgar-Unity).

~~The plugin is currently in its early alpha stage, so you should be prepared to deal with bugs, incomplete documentation, lack of features, etc. The plugin is also far from usable in production scenarios, mainly due to its performance issues which will be addressed in future versions.~~

You can find the plugin on [my github](https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/Edgar-Unity).
